# History

I intially made [a reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/2d9f7i/survey_of_python_object_systems/) followed by [a post to comp.lang.python](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.python/vW9JTTI1GBA) on this subject. 

When [metaparams was posted to the Python reddit](https://github.com/mementum/metaparams) I figured it was about time to have a central directory of such systems.
